# Text-Classification


## Text classification
Text Classification is the task of assigning a label or class to a given text. This is the heart of different NLP systems.

## This project:

This project applies the typical workflow of machine learning projects. Starting from the data collection phase, we proceed to apply data cleaning and normalization techniques, feature engineering for text data, and modeling with three different algorithms. After Choosing our champion model, we conduct an **Erorr Analysis** phase, at which we identify the words that confused our classifer.


## How to run the code?

You need to install the following libraries:
- Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplot.
- Gensim, NLLTK.
